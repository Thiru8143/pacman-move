 Pac-Man Animation Project

This project creates a simple animation of Pac-Man characters that move around a defined container. The Pac-Man characters bounce off the walls, and their images switch based on their movement direction.

## Demo

## How It Works

1. *Add Pac-Man: Click the *"Add Pacman"** button to add a Pac-Man character to the container. Each Pac-Man is placed at a random position with a random velocity.
2. *Start Game: Click the *"Start Game"** button to start moving all Pac-Man characters within the container.
3. *Bouncing Effect*: The Pac-Man characters bounce off the walls of the container, changing their direction upon collision.
4. *Image Switching*: The image of each Pac-Man character changes as it moves, giving the appearance of animation.

## Technologies Used

- *HTML*: For structuring the page and elements.
- *CSS*: For styling the container and positioning elements.
- *JavaScript*: For creating the Pac-Man characters, managing their movement, and updating the animation.
